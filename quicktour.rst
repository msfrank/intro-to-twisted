A Quick Tour
============

Twisted comes with a rich library of protocol implementations.  Here is a short
(and by no means complete) list of what you can use straight out of the box:

 * twisted.web: A web server and client
 * twisted.words: Chat services such as IRC, Jabber, AIM, and MSN
 * twisted.mail: Mail transport and retrieval (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
 * twisted.conch: Shell access via Telnet or SSH
 * twisted.names: DNS server and client

In addition, there are many external libraries which interface with twisted.  Here
are a few interesting ones:

 * txAMQP: Message queuing client
 * txAWS: Interact with Amazon AWS and Eucalyptus
 * Thrift: Bindings can be generated for twisted
 * txprotobuf: implementation of google protocol buffers for twisted
