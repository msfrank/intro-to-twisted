Why Use Twisted?
----------------

Twisted as a whole brings a number of specific benefits:

 * Twisted scales very well, handling many concurrent network connections.
 * Twisted comes out of the box with support for a large array of application
   protocols.
 * Twisted has an ecosystem of external libraries which integrate with the
   twisted reactor.
 * Twisted is a mature codebase, with excellent test coverage, and has been
   proven in production.

However, there are some caveats:

 * Twisted does not support python 3.
 * Twisted adds a certain amount of complexity to your code, and event driven
   programming is not always easy to visualize.
 * Twisted development progresses somewhat slowly.
